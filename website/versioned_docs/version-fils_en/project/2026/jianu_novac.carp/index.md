## Description

An RC car controlled via Wi-Fi from a mobile phone, designed to jump approximately 75cm (average desk height) and land safely to perform a physical USB injection attack on a target laptop. The design may resemble a monster truck toy to "camouflage" better.

## Motivation

Initially, I wanted to build a cybersecurity-oriented project, because I am quite passionate about the subject, but I also wanted it to be flashy. My first ideas were a bizarre hardware token or a Wi-Fi IDS monitor, but they weren't exciting enough. Then I remembered the Jumper from Watch Dogs 2 and decided to build something inspired by it.

## Architecture

Add here the schematics with the architecture of your project. Make sure to include:

* what the main components are (architecture components, not hardware components)
* how they connect to each other

## Log

### Week 20 - 25 April

* Ordered 99% of all the components online. I need to find a place that sells industrial springs strong enough to jump a 1 kg RC car into the air.
* Brainstormed ideas for the jump mechanism.
* A few rough sketches on paper for now.

### Week 5 - 11 May
- learned fusion 360 , finished 90% percent of the 3d render, only the injection mechanism and the camera cage are unfinished.
- printed the base layer of the car, dropped it on the ground, it broke , 
- decide to print it again and do some modification to add some resistance. 
- started writing the code for the control of the motors 
- soldered my picos

* Learned Fusion 360, finished 90% of the 3D render; only the injection mechanism and the camera cage are unfinished.
* Printed the base layer of the car, dropped it on the ground, and it broke.
* Decided to print it again and do some modifications to add some resistance.
* Started writing the code to control the motors.
* Soldered my Picos.

### Week 12 - 18 May

* Switched to Pico 2 W.
* Did a lot of 3D modeling; I wasted too much time on this part.
* Tested the powerful motor that will compress the spring, and it works.
* Got hardware materials like metal rods and knock-off Wagos for the power system.

### Week 19 - 25 May

* Designed the power system.
* Tested and implemented full RC control of the motors and servos using the web server.
* 3D printed the base and second level of the car.
* Finally finished all the 3D modeling.
* Random side-quest: broke the JGA25-370 motor (the spring motor), but repaired it.
* Tested a cardboard box prototype.
* Achieved remote control of the car.
* 3D printed the camera case.
* Designed the injector mechanism.

### Week 26 - 30 May

* Final stretch.
* Finished 3D modeling the jumping mechanism; it is ready to be printed.
* Broke a pole on the first level of the car; I don't care, it still works.
* Fried my main driver and step-up module; I can't replace them now, it's too late.
* Implemented the MPU-6050 sensor.
* On the last day before the PM-fair, I achieved the performance of short-circuiting 4 components: the step-up (which was crucial, now bye-bye motor), the L298N driver (bye-bye motor control), the VL53L0X (I found another, but we will find out if I can get my hands on it until tomorrow, it's 11:47 as I am logging this), and a small servo that didn't work, but a friend helped me and gave me another.

Conclusion of the project: I spent way too much time 3D designing the components and chose a way too complex theme from a mechanical point of view. The whole project is barely working from a technical point of view. If I were to start over, I would choose an easier idea. I learned a lot of new stuff, at least.

## Hardware

Simple RC car, uses a simple hardware setup, keeping in mind the shocks it will suffer from jumping.
Control: Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W, while the ESP32-CAM provides live video.
Jumping mech: High-torque JGA25 motor compresses a steel spring, released by the MG996R servo latch.
Drive: 4x TT motors with custom 3D-printed TPU wheels for traction and shock absorption.
Power: Gens Ace LiPo Battery regulated by an XL4015 5A Buck converter to keep the servos and logic rails stable during the jumps.
Sensing: VL53L0X measuring altitude, and MPU6050 monitors stability and landing orientation.
Injector: MG90S servo deploys the USB.

| --- | --- | --- |
| **embassy-rp** | HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) for RP2350 (Pico 2W) | Controls physical pins: GPIO for the MGR98 motor, PWM for servos and the L298N motor driver, and the I2C interface for the sensors. |
| **embassy-executor** | Async task executor designed for microcontrollers | Runs multiple tasks concurrently in the background, like managing the Wi-Fi chip and running the web server. |
| **embassy-time** | Async timers and delays | Allows the code to pause (e.g., interval between sensor readings) without blocking the entire processor. |
| **embassy-sync** | Async synchronization primitives (Mutex, Channels) | Helps tasks communicate safely and share data without causing race conditions or conflicts. |
| **embassy-futures** | Utility functions for working with Futures | Combines async actions, such as waiting for web requests and reading sensors at the same time. |

| **embassy-net** | Async TCP/IP networking stack | Handles network communication, gets an IP address via DHCP, and runs the HTTP server for the web interface. |
| **cyw43** | Driver for the CYW43439 Wi-Fi chip | Manages the wireless connection, connects to the access point, and handles Wi-Fi data packets. |
| **cyw43-pio** | PIO-based interface for the cyw43 driver | Uses the Pico's programmable I/O (PIO) blocks to talk to the Wi-Fi chip at high speeds. |
| **mipidsi** | MIPI DSI / SPI display driver | Included in the project to control and initialize the color screen if physical display output is needed. |

| **static_cell** | Safe runtime initialization of static variables | Safely initializes global statics needed for the Wi-Fi state and network stack resources. |
| **defmt** | Highly efficient logging framework | Prints debug messages to the console with minimal memory footprint and overhead compared to `println!`. |
| **defmt-rtt** | RTT (Real-Time Transfer) transport for defmt | Channels the logging output from the Pico directly to your PC console via the debugger. |
| **panic-probe** | Panic handler for debugger probes | If the firmware crashes, it catches the panic and prints the exact source file and line number to the console. |
