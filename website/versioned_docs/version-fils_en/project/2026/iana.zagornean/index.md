## Description

A self-contained WiFi-enabled robotic car built around an ESP32-WROOM development board. The
system creates its own wireless network, allowing a phone, laptop, or controller device to
connect directly and control the vehicle through a browser-based web interface. The car uses 
TB6612FNG dual-channel motor driver to control the left and right motor groups independently,
enabling forward movement, reverse movement, and turning in place.

The project includes multiple operating modes. In manual mode, the user controls the car from
the web page or through a connected gamepad. In autonomous mode, a VL53L0X
time-of-flight distance sensor is used to detect obstacles, while a servo motor rotates the
sensor to scan left, center, and right before choosing a safer direction. In line-following
mode, a 5-channel TCRT5000 infrared sensor module detects a black line on the ground and
allows the robot to follow it automatically.

An OLED SSD1306 display is mounted on the robot to show important live information such as
current mode, command, distance value, WiFi status, and battery level. An ESP32-CAM module
with an OV2640 camera is used as a separate WiFi camera unit. It connects to the robot’s WiFi
network and provides a live video stream that is displayed inside the main web control
interface.

## Motivation

This project was chosen to explore how embedded systems, robotics, and Rust can be combined into a complete, real-world application. It provides hands-on experience with controlling hardware components like motors and sensors while also implementing higher-level features such
as WiFi communication and a browser-based interface. Building a fully standalone system that can be controlled remotely helps in understanding how modern IoT devices operate without
external dependencies. Additionally, it offers valuable insight into debugging hardware-software interactions and lays the groundwork for extending the project with more advanced capabilities like autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance.

A dual-channel TB6612FNG motor driver manages the left and right motors independently, enabling forward, reverse, and turning movements.
A time-of-flight sensor (VL53L0X) monitors distance to obstacles, while a servo motor can rotate the sensor to scan the environment. The device exposes live telemetry (movement status, distance readings, safety flags) in the browser and uses a buzzer to signal warnings such as approaching obstacles.
The software is fully implemented in Rust and runs directly on the microcontroller, integrating motor control, networking, and real-time feedback into a compact and autonomous embedded system.

## Log


### Week 1 - 4

Defined the project idea: a WiFi-controlled robotic car using ESP32-C3.
Researched motor drivers (TB6612FNG), sensors (VL53L0X), and Rust support for embedded systems.
Planned overall architecture (control via web interface + real-time telemetry).

### Week 5 - 6

Ordered components and started assembling the hardware.
Mounted motors on the chassis and prepared wiring for power distribution.
Studied ESP32 pinout and how to interface with the TB6612FNG driver.

### Week 7 - 8

Connected ESP32-C3 to the motor driver and powered the system.
Tested GPIO signals and verified connections using a multimeter.
Started debugging motor behavior (direction issues, inactive channels).

### Week 9 - 10

Connected the VL53L0X distance sensor through I2C and added distance readings to the web
interface. Added servo control so the sensor could scan different directions. Implemented an
autonomous obstacle-avoidance mode where the robot checks the front distance, stops near
obstacles, scans left and right, and chooses a safer direction.

### Week 11 - 12

Added the 5-channel TCRT5000 line sensor module. Implemented line sensor reading, pattern detection, and a line-following mode. Added calibration and debugging for the sensor values. Updated the web interface to show the detected line pattern and the estimated line position.

### Week 13 - 14

Added an OLED SSD1306 display over I2C. The display shows the current operating mode, active command, distance reading, WiFi status, and battery percentage. Added battery voltage monitoring using a voltage divider connected to an ADC pin. Improved code organization by splitting the project into multiple Rust files such as configuration, motors, servos, sensors, OLED, web page, web server, and application state.

## Hardware

The hardware is built around an ESP32-WROOM development board, which acts as the main controller, creates the WiFi network, runs the web server, and controls the robot. A TB6612FNG motor driver controls the left and right DC motors using GPIO and PWM signals. The robot uses a VL53L0X distance sensor for obstacle detection, a 5-channel TCRT5000 sensor module for line following, two servo motors for positioning, and an SSD1306 OLED display for showing live status such as mode, command, distance, WiFi state, and battery level. The battery level is measured through a voltage divider connected to an ADC pin, while an ESP32-CAM with an OV2640 camera connects through WiFi and provides the live video stream. The system is powered by a 2S battery pack with voltage regulation, and all modules share a common ground.

## Hardware

The hardware setup is built around the ESP32-C3 microcontroller, which acts as the main control unit and provides WiFi connectivity. A TB6612FNG motor driver is used to control two DC motors for movement (left and right). A VL53L0X time-of-flight distance sensor is connected via I2C for obstacle detection, while a servo motor is used to rotate the sensor for environmental scanning. An active buzzer provides audio feedback for alerts. The system is powered by a battery pack with a voltage regulator, and all components are connected using jumper wires on a prototyping setup.
