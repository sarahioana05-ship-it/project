## Description

My Project Idea: A sonar radar using a Time-of-Flight (ToF) distance sensor to detect foreign objects in an area, when an object enters the sonar's radius, an alert sound queue will occur, the sonar measures accross an area with both manual (using buttons) and automatic movements (using a button to switch modes).

## Motivation

I chose to make this because I'm very passionate about Intel-gathering gadgets and I wanted to persue many more similar ideas, this is a concept I really found interesting and I wanted to replicate it.

## Architecture 

Control Layer: NUCLEO-U545RE-Q microcontroller running Rust with Embassy.
Handles servo control (PWM), reads distance data via I2C from the sensor, processes button inputs, manages automatic/manual scanning logic, generates buzzer signals/sound queues, and streams radar data (angle + distance) to the laptop over USB.

Sensing Layer: VL53L0X Time-of-Flight (ToF) distance sensor mounted on a custom rotating platform.
it measures distance in real time at the current angle using time-of-flight (ToF) technology, providing precise range data for radar visualization via laptop.

Actuation Layer: SG90 Micro Servo Motor driven by PWM signals from the MCU.
Rotates the sensor across a 0°–180° sweep, allowing spatial scanning of the environment. movement supports both automatic scan and manual directional control via user input using buttons, when in manual mode and inactive for ~3 seconds, the system returns back to automatic sweeping mode.

## Log

<!-- write your progress here every week -->

### Week 11 - 11 May

Parts arrived and some we're faulty, needed time to reorder the parts and also adjusted some changes for what the project will have, costed extra time

### Week 12 - 18 May

Ordered parts, displays etc but decided to use a GUI on my laptop, so the project needed some readjustments, I had push buttons for control on the prototype for testing

### Week 14 - 25 May

Reviewing final issues with my code, the components worked fine but the GUI had trouble recognising the ToF
