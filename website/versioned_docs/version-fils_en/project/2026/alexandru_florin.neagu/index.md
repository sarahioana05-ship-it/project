## Description

This project represents a **karaoke device** that lets a user pick a song from their phone, stream it via bluetooth to a small dedicated speaker system, and see synchronized lyrics scroll on both their phone and a on-device display - all while a separate display shows the temperature and a small fun LED matrix goes through different colours!!

The system is split into **two physical boards** that cooperate over Bluetooth and SPI:

- The **audio path** is a hardware-only board built around an MH-M38 Bluetooth audio receiver that drives a small amplifier and the speakers. The phone pairs to it directly.
- The **brain board** runs a Rust firmware on an **STM32U545RE-Q**, drives two small **ST7789V TFT displays**, a **MAX7219 8x8 LED matrix** and a **DHT22/AM2302 temperature/humidity sensor**, and talks to an **ESP32-WROOM-32** over SPI. The ESP32 acts as the Bluetooth Classic bridge that hands lyrics and control commands from the phone to the STM32.

## Motivation

I chose this project because karaoke is fun and my last project idea sadly died after my motor microcontrollers decided to not work and 2 of them were fried. Fortunately karaoke is even more fun!

## Architecture

This is the diagram regarding how the project is organized:

These are the current KiCAD diagrams for the project depicting the power distribution and the communication protocols between the STM32 brain board and its peripherals (the ST7789V display over SPI2 and SPI3, each display, the MAX7219 matrix over SPI2, the ESP32 link over SPI1, and the DHT22 sensor on a single GPIO line.

## Log

<!-- write your progress here every week -->
### Week 6: 30 March - 6 April

Coming up with possible project ideas.

### Week 7: 6 - 12 April

Conceptual stage, thinking how I would want my gimbal project to work, coming up with ideas regarding components and spending a *lot* of time looking for correct/compatible components, as I think this project is a bit complex for my current level of understading.

### Week 8: 12 - 18 April

Ordering a big part of components (motors, drivers+encoders, STM32 board). More research.

### Week 9: 19 - 25 April

Ordering next batch of components (IMU, battery and charger). More research x2. Changed to attempting CAN connection (lord have mercy).

### Week 10: 26 April - 2 May

Arrival of most components. Realised I need for the CAN bus a twisted pair insulated wire, had lots of trouble finding some available in Romania till I found some and ordered. Started working on the 3D printed components, the motor magnet couplings, the driver cages and the arms, alongside prototyping ways for cable management in Fusion 360.

### Week 11: 3 - 9 May

Finished designing the driver cages, still working on the rest of the components. Cable arrived. Realised my drivers have small can cables which I need to further connect to perfboards to fulfill CAN Bus conditions. 
Starting thinking about the KiCAD schematic and the different communication protocols required for pin connections between the board and the peripherals.

### Week 12: 10 - 16 May

Finished the KiCAD schematic and submitted to Git branch for review by lab assistants. Worked on setting up motor drivers and motors with USB-C connection and integrated ODrive Python programs developed for MKS XDRive Mini. 
Still working on 3D design for arms and rails for coupling the 3 axis components.

### Week 13: 18 - 23 May

Things started going horribly wrong. 2 drivers fried, lots of components purchased and unusable, I ended up changing my project idea from SteadyFrame to KaraBox, the karaoke idea... Very little available working time. Lots of stress.

### Week 14: 25 - 30 May

Components started arriving and I started assembly whenever I didnt have tests (mostly nights...). Managed to get everything working, relatively well.

Added photos during the building process and a final one with the box and the speakers from after the PM Fair with the cardboard box prototype.
