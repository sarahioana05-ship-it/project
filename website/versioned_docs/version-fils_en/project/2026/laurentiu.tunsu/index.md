## Description

A bare-metal handheld game console built on the Raspberry Pi Pico 2 (RP2350), running a custom Rust port of the game "Wolfenstein 3D".
The system is designed for standalone portability, and it integrates a dedicated battery management module and an 8-bit parallel display interface to ensure high frame rates; it features an integrated sd card reader for asset storage, twin joysticks for the FPS controls, and four buttons used to shoot, pause, and navigate the game menu, all being managed directly at the hardware register level.

## Motivation

As an aspiring game developer and software engineer, I approached this project as an opportunity to push my technical skills and create a standout piece for my portfolio. Beyond the engineering challenge, I am fascinated by retro consoles, both their physical design and the history of their creation. I have always admired how early developers managed to develop memorable games despite extreme hardware limitations. Building this bare-metal console is my way of experiencing that era of development firsthand, learning how to tightly optimize software to run flawlessly on highly constrained hardware. 

## Architecture 

The provided diagram illustrates the hardware architecture of the custom handheld game console.

The architecture is divided into five primary logical subsystems that operate concurrently to maintain a stable high frame rate:

* **Processing Subsystem:** The microcontroller (RP2350) powers the entire system. It runs the asynchronous Embassy executor, calculates the heavy floating-point raycasting math, and manages the Finite State Machine (FSM) for gameplay and power states.
* **Display Subsystem:** Rather than using a CPU-blocking serial connection, the display architecture utilizes an 8-bit parallel bus. The processor renders frame buffers into RAM, and a Direct Memory Access (DMA) channel automatically streams that data to the Programmable I/O (PIO). The PIO handles the high speed hardware pin toggling, allowing the screen to update independently while the CPU calculates the next frame.
* **Input Subsystem:** This subsystem isolates user actions. Action buttons are connected directly to the microcontroller's GPIO pins with hardware interrupts. Analog inputs (joysticks) are offloaded to a dedicated external 16-bit ADC, which digitizes the data and transmits it to the processor via the I2C bus.
* **Storage Subsystem:** Bypassing the limited internal flash memory, this subsystem utilizes the SPI0 bus to interface with an external SD card. It provides necessary level layouts and texture data directly into the processor's RAM during loading states.
* **Power & Audio Subsystem:** A rechargeable battery feeds power to the entire system and is easily recharged through the USB module. At the same time, a passive buzzer plays basic sound effects in the background.

<!-- write your progress here every week -->

### Week 4 - Project Theme Research
- Initially I considered developing/porting quite simple Nintendo games such as "Super Mario Bros." to the RP2350, but it is not my favorite genre of games. 
- Began deep search on early FPS titles and immediately "DOOM" popped my mind, but after further analysis regarding the developing time and resources, I fell back to a slightly easier approach, "Wolfenstein 3D".

### Week 5 - Hardware Components & Software Research
- Analyzed the hardware bottlenecks of rendering 3D (technically 2.5D) graphics on a microcontroller. Realized a standard SPI display connection would be too slow to hit my 24-30 FPS target, so I chose an 8-bit parallel bus architecture, utilizing the Pico's PIO and a DMA channel.
- Selected the `embassy-rp` async framework for concurrent task management and `micromath` for fast floating-point raycasting approximations.
- Finalized the pinout mapping to ensure I had enough GPIO pins for the display, I2C ADC, SPI SD card, and buttons without conflicts. Placed the order for all components.

### Week 6 - Components Arrival
- All the hardware components arrived (Pico 2H boards, display shield, ADS1115, joysticks, buttons, buzzer, wires, breadboards, and power modules).
- Soldered the necessary pin headers onto the ADS1115 module. I decided to pause on soldering the battery and charging module until a later stage of the project.
- Started the breadboard prototyping phase to test the wiring. During this process, I realized my design uses every single available GPIO pin on the Pico, which means I have to be extremely careful and stick strictly to the schematic moving forward.

### Week 7 - Components Testing
- Set up the secondary Raspberry Pi Pico 2H as a Picoprobe hardware debugger. 
- Wrote basic test scripts to verify peripheral communication: successfully scanned the I2C bus to find the ADS1115 and read raw analog values from the PS2 joysticks. 
- Verified the Omron action buttons using the Pico's internal pull-up resistors and logged the presses to the PC via UART.

### Week 8 - Further Testing & Issues
- **Issue:** Encountered display flickering and persistent white-screen errors when trying to initialize the ILI9341 shield. 
- **Fix:** After a few hours of troubleshooting the software, I discovered the root cause was actually the hardware wiring. The data pins on the display were arranged in an unconventional order (D2 through D7, followed by D0 and D1, rather than a standard sequential D0 to D7). Rewiring the 8-bit bus to match this exact layout immediately resolved the issue.

### Week 9 - 11 - Performance Improvements
- **Issue:** Extremely low frame rate when running the primitive implemented raycaster, caused by the standard blocking GPIO writes over the 8 bit parallel interface which put high load on the CPU.
- **Fix:** Implemented a custom display driver to bypass the standard CPU bound bit banging. Offloaded the display communication to the RP2350's PIO (Programmable I/O) by writing a custom timing program to send the data. Paired this PIO program with DMA (Direct Memory Access), streaming the frame buffers asynchronously from RAM to the screen. This dropped CPU rendering overhead to near zero, dramatically increasing the raycaster's framerate.

### Week 12 - 13 - Texture Work
- Designed a custom 320x576 all in one texture in Photoshop to optimize and save memory. It packs every 16-bit RGB565 asset into one sprite sheet: the wall textures, enemy sprites, collectible items, HUD elements, and menu overlays. 
- Also set up strict color keying to avoid the transparency/anti aliasing artifacts.

### Week 14 - Final Polishing
- Added the final mechanics, such as saving and loading the game state. The menu rendering has been completely switched from embedded graphics to a custom texture blitter to get rid of a massive crash bug, allowing for a fully functional and stable UI.
- Several improvements have been made to the engine architecture, including a new movement collision buffer to prevent camera clipping, optimized memory safety for static variables, and corrected sprite coordinates for menus and overlays.
- Integrated new gameplay features: a final dedicated victory screen, step based Line of Sight raycasting for accurate weapon hit registration, partial consumption logic for items, and an asynchronous PWM audio task toggleable via a new Options menu.


## Hardware

**Current Prototype & Future Plans:**
Currently, the entire console is prototyped on breadboards using jumper wires to validate the complex logic and pinout architecture. Once the software is fully developed, the next goal is to design a custom PCB and to 3D print a custom case.

### Component Breakdown
* **Microcontrollers:** Two Raspberry Pi Pico 2H boards are utilized. One acts as the main processing engine, while the second serves as a dedicated hardware debugger (Picoprobe) for serial logging.
* **Display & Storage:** A 2.8-inch ILI9341 TFT display provides the visual output, taking advantage of the 8-bit parallel connection. The display shield natively houses the MicroSD card reader used for streaming game assets.
* **Input Controls:** Two PS2-style analog joysticks capture player movement and camera rotation, digitized by an external ADS1115 16-bit ADC to preserve pins. Four Omron tactile switches handle digital inputs like shooting, pausing, and menu navigation.
* **Power & Audio:** A 3.7V 1000mAh LiPo battery provides power, regulated by a TP4056 module that allows for safe USB charging. A passive buzzer is driven by hardware PWM to handle the game's retro audio output.
